## Why?

I wanted a Pomodoro app that:

- Adds simple gamification to the pomodoro technique
- Gives you incentive to increase your focus time on any task
- Allows you to work offline and completely untracked
- Minimizes the complexity of other Pomodoro Apps.
- Acknoledges the user's successes when a reward is claimed.
